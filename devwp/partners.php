IMB has one goal: bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to the lost peoples of the world. Southern Baptist churches believe that by working cooperatively, they can accomplish more for God’s kingdom.

Technological advances have provided unprecedented opportunities to spread the gospel into areas previously considered forbidden by political barriers. Every believer has a part to play in the Great Commission, and IMB is dedicated to forging the pathways necessary to connect each church with the work of missionary teams across the globe.</p>
