                    <p class = "no-margin no-padding">Charis is the Greek word for grace, God's undeserved favor that He provides for mankind. Charis in Action equips disciples of Jesus to both share and demonstrate the love of Jesus Christ. It is literally God's grace in action throughout the world. The foundation of everything we do is rooted in the Great Commission: “Go and make disciples of all nations” Matthew 28:19. It is our passion to make Jesus known to every nation, tribe, people, and language. Therefore, we partner with, equip, and send missional servants to faithfully carry out the Great Commission. We believe the local church is the primary biblical sending organization. However, some churches and church leaders do not understand or embrace this commitment. We want to help followers of Jesus have a pathway to engage in the global mission of God.</p>
